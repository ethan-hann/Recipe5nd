# Recipe5nd
No longer do you have to wonder what you can cook! If you have an Android phone, you can use this app to search for recipes using ingredients you already have available to you. You can also:
* keep track of the ingredients you have in a pantry list
* favorite your frequently used recipes for quick access
* keep multiple shopping lists to help you track ingredients in a recipe you may not have available

This application makes use of Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) to provide a clear and clean user interface and experience.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. If you wish to only install the application, see deployment.

* [Gradle 3.5.2](https://gradle.org/releases/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
